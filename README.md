# Hytale Server

Docker image to run a Hytale server.

For now just clone the repo and build the image yourself.

For convenience I have some scripts attached:

- `restart.sh` - (re)start the server from the compose file
- `attach.sh` - attach to the server console

This was just thrown together. Security and usability will be improved later...
